What's new in version 4.

*	This version does not support Delphi 4 and C++ Builer 4 anymore.


+ There are new components for unified loading tabular information from 
	server to client with after-treatment this data on the client:
  editing, sorting, filtrations and unloading changed given on 
  the server back. Components do not include drivers to access to server.
  To ensure functionality of components it is sufficiently to write a 
  global event that execute SQL expression with parameters using your 
  favorite access data base engine and return DataSet-cursor.

  The technology is represented by two main component:
    TMemTableEh - dataset, which hold all data in memory.
    You can consider it as array of records.
      More other it:
        Supports a special interface, that allows DBGridEh component 
          to view all datas without moving active record.
        Allows load data from TDataDriverEh (DataDriver property).
        Allows to unload changes back to DataDriver, operative or postponed 
          (in dependencies of CachedUpdates property).
        Allows to create master/datail relationship on client side 
          (by filterring record) or on external source (by updating 
          parameters [Params] and requering data from DetailDataDriver).
        Allows to sort datas, including Calculated and Lookup field.
        Allows to create and fill data at design-time and save data in dfm
          file of the form.
        Allows to keep records tree like relations. Each record can 
          have record nodes and work as node of parental record. TDBGridEh 
          component can show of the tree-type structure of records.
        Allows to show internal array of other TMemTableEh ( ExternalMemData 
          property ) and work with this data: sort, filter, edit.
        Has an interface to get the list of all values of the field, 
         ignoring local filter. TDBGridEh uses this property for
         automatic building a list in DropDownBox of the filter.

     TDataDriverEh - executes two tasks:
        1. Delivers records in TMemTableEh.
        2. Processes records, changed in TMemTableEh (writes them in other 
           dataset, or call events for processing the changes to the program).

     Furthermore, there are several components that inheritted from TDataDriverEh.
     It is a TSQLDataDriverEh, that have properies to keep four SQL expressions and 
     parameters for querying data, removing a record, insertions record, 
     updating record and querying one record. TSQLDataDriverEh can not requests data
     from server, but can prepare parameters of the request and call global
     event, where programm can transfer SQL expression on the server.
     There are several components that inherited from TSQLDataDriverEh, which
     can send SQL expressions on the server through the corresponding access engine.
     It is TBDEDataDriverEh, TIBXDataDriverEh, TDBXDataDriverEh and TADODataDriverEh 
     component.

     There are a powerful design-time editors for TMemTableEh and TSQLDataDriverEh.


* New version of TDBGridEh has changed a parent. Now TCustomDBGridEh is inheritted 
  from TCustomGridEh. If in your forms DBGrid and DBGridEh are not used
  simultaneously then turning on the new version must not appear a problems.
  However in some cases compiler can raise error about inconsistency of 
  Grids.TGridDrawState and GridsEh.TGridDrawState types or similar errors. 
  To deliverance from this errors it is necessary to delete 'Grids' and 
  'DBGrids' unit from the 'uses' clause. If 'Grids' and 
  'DBGrids' are necessary in the uses clause, then it is need to move
  these strings in place before 'GridsEh' and 'DBGridEh'.
  If even in this case you will get error messages about TGridDrawState types,
  it is necessary to elaborate the name of type by the name of the module.
  For instance write GridsEh.TGridDrawState or Grids.TGridDrawState instead 
  of TGridDrawState.


+ In TDBGridEh 
    Added ContraColCount property. Property defines amount write nonscrolled
    columns. These columns can not get a input focus.

+ If DBGridEh is connected to TMemTableEh, then it allows:
    View all datas, not moving active record.
    Show data as tree (If TMemTableEh is in the TreeList mode).
    Move records as tree-node in tree (When dgsRowMoving is in OptionsEh).
    Automatic building a list in DropDownBox of the filter cell.
